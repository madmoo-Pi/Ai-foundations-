This project—**Self Conscious AI** (as inferred from your folder structure)—is a production-ready framework aimed at building safe, auditable, and robust AI systems with special focus on ethics, hardware/resource safety, self-modification, reinforcement learning, and DevSecOps best practices.

---

## **Key Features**

### 1. **Ethics Engine**
- **Location:** `core/ethics.py`
- **Purpose:** Applies tamper-proof, auditable ethical rules to all actions (e.g., "Do not harm humans") using regex pattern matching.
- **Highlights:** Tamper detection, comprehensive audit logging, extensible rule definitions, and secure rule storage.

### 2. **Hardware Resource Allocator**
- **Location:** `core/hardware/allocator.py`
- **Purpose:** Ensures safe operation by enforcing CPU/memory limits using Linux cgroups or process monitoring (via `psutil`).
- **Highlights:** Container/cgroup awareness, failsafe checks, and seamless fallback to process-level metrics.

### 3. **Self-Modification System**
- **Location:** `core/self_mod/hotpatch.py`
- **Purpose:** Allows controlled, versioned hotpatching of code with strong safety guarantees.
- **Highlights:** AST-based static analysis (blocks e.g. `eval`/`exec`), secure sandboxing, rollback/version history, and automatic cleanup of failed patches.

### 4. **Reinforcement Learning Trainer**
- **Location:** `rl/trainer.py`
- **Purpose:** Robust, fault-tolerant trainer for cross-modal RL models.
- **Highlights:** Input normalization, model/stat checkpointing, error recovery with rollback, and type-safe design.

### 5. **Testing & CI/CD**
- **Location:** `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, `tests/`
- **Purpose:** Automated code quality, security, and correctness checks.
- **Highlights:** Pytest-based unit/integration tests, static type checking (mypy), and security scanning (ShiftLeft).

### 6. **Documentation & Best Practices**
- Every core module includes:
  - Typed interfaces
  - Complete docstrings
  - Error handling
  - Example usage in unit tests

## **Example Use Case / Deployment**

This repo is ready for secure, containerized deployment and production monitoring:

```bash
docker build -t ai_system .
docker run -it \
  --cpus 2 \
  --memory 4g \
  --device /dev/sgx/enclave \
  -v /var/log/ai:/var/log \
  ai_system
```
