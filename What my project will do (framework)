Your project implements a **Conscious AI System with privacy-focused facial recognition, strong ethical constraints, dynamic personality, sensory input, emotional intelligence, a knowledge graph, and a modular terminal interface**. Here’s a high-level summary based on your code:

## What Your Project Does

### 1. **Privacy-Focused Facial Recognition**
- Recognizes and remembers faces based only on hashes (no images stored).
- Progresses relationships from “Recognized” → “Familiar” → “Friend” based on positive interactions.
- Automatically deletes inactive face data after 30 days (unless “force remembered”).
- Requires explicit consent for facial processing and allows instant opt-out/deletion.

### 2. **Ethical AI Framework**
- All inputs, outputs, and actions are validated against a set of ethical rules (e.g., no harm, privacy, no self-replication, consent for facial data).
- Tampering with the ethics core triggers an emergency lock.
- Logs all ethical violations for review.

### 3. **Dynamic Personality System**
- 15 personality traits, each progressively unlocked based on interaction and exposure.
- Friendship-aware personality: responses are influenced by relationship level.
- Supports plug-and-play external personality modules, with validation and sandboxing for safety.

### 4. **Sensor Integration**
- Modular sensor hub supports camera, microphone, and thermal sensors.
- Sensors are hot-swappable, calibratable, and their readings feed into the AI’s perception.
- Camera sensor simulates facial captures with consent.

### 5. **Emotional Intelligence**
- Converts sensory data into a “qualia” representation, then classifies into 8 emotional types (e.g., Joy, Fear, Curiosity).
- Active emotion influences the AI’s response styling (e.g., adds emoji).

### 6. **Knowledge Locker and Graph**
- Tracks exposure and unlocking of both emotions and personality traits.
- Maintains a semantic knowledge graph, allowing for relationships between concepts.

### 7. **Ethically-Constrained Memory**
- AI stores and recalls memories, but only after ethical validation.
- Limited capacity, with least-important memories forgotten first.

### 8. **User Terminal Interface**
- Command-based terminal for interacting with the AI.
- Supports facial recognition commands, sensor management, module loading, status reporting, and more.
- Example commands: `/face capture`, `/face remember`, `/addsensor`, `/modules`, `/enable`, `/status`.

## Example: What Can a User Do?

- **Check system status:** `/status`
- **Interact with sensors:** `/addsensor camera RearCam`, `/calibrate Front Camera 1.5`
- **Use facial recognition ethically:** `/face capture "Front Camera" --consent`
- **Manage relationships:** `/face remember [hash] Alice coffee=black`
- **Monitor and influence personality:** `/modules`, `/enable creative`
- **See AI’s emotion in response to the environment and interaction.**

## In Short

**Your project is an advanced ethical AI simulation platform** that allows users to interact with a privacy-conscious, emotionally-aware, sensor-driven digital “entity,” complete with personality development, facial recognition (with consent), and a modular terminal interface. It’s suitable for research, educational, or experimental applications in AI ethics, HCI, and artificial consciousness.
