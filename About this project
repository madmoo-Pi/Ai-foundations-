My project is a modular, production-grade AI system that prioritizes safety, 
self-auditability, and resilience. It integrates ethical constraint enforcement,
resource management, secure self-modification, robust RL training,
automated testing, and security scanningâ€”making its a strong foundation for responsible AI deployment.
